# asset-pipe-test-es5a

This is an internal module intended for use in testing by other modules in the
[asset-pipe project][asset-pipe].

In the [asset-pipe projects][asset-pipe] there is need for a set of small and
stable modules we have control over which we can use as source dependencies in
testing to make sure tests are consistent between modules.

This is one such module. It is not intended for any other use.



## Installation

```bash
$ npm install asset-pipe-test-es5a --save
```
